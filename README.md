# Music Releases

50 new album releases that we are displaying on an landing page with a local json-file(API).

## Getting Started with the Project

Got a good start and thought i understood it pretty well, but had difficultis displaying the API data and it took a long time before i got it to work. Which was my main problem and got me real stuck! But managed to solve it.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I understood the principle of React pretty fast, how to work with components. But thought it was difficult to know how to divid everything up and how many components it should be. But it gets clearer! Have to few components in this project - but realised that to late and let it be, but next time i will divide it into more smaller components.
